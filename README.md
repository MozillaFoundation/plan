# The Mozilla Foundation Planning Repo

The work in this repo reflects ongoing issues related to the Foundation's [five-year strategic plan](https://wiki.mozilla.org/MoFo_2020).

Here is our [2016 calendar](http://mzl.la/2016_calendar) (in progress).

## Proposing new work
If you'd like to propose new work, head on over to http://build.webmaker.org/add and submit a new project. Or simply [file an issue](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/plan/issues) in this repo. New issues are triaged every other Friday.

## Label conventions
The Plan repo's labels follow a few conventions, such as orange for all of our Advocacy initiatives and blue for all of our Leadership Network pieces. New custom labels can be created to track specific projects if you'd like.

Here's a list of labels (as pruned in Dec 2015) that reflect our 2016 initiatives:
